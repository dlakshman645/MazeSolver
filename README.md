# MazeSolver

MazeSolver is a Java program that generates a maze, allows the user to visualize it, and find a solution path using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.

## Features

- Generate a random maze with a start and end point.
- Visualize the maze with color-coded elements (start, end, walls, open paths, and solution path).
- Find the solution path using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.
- Interactive console-based user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)
- Data Structures and Algorithms Using Java

Open the project in your Java IDE.

Run the MazeSolver class.

Follow the on-screen instructions to generate and solve mazes.

How to Use
Choose the size of the maze (n) when prompted.
Select options from the menu:
Print the path using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Generate another maze.
Exit the program.
Print the path using Depth-First Search (DFS).
